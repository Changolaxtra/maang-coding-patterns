# maang-coding-patterns

This repository has the purpose to have Java implementation examples of MAANG Coding Patterns, trying to make them
easily extendable to different functionalities by providing functional interfaces.

- MAANG -> Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google
- MAANG -> Mandatory Algorithms for the Next Generation (I like this one :sunglasses:)

The following list was extracted
from [DesignGurus.com - Linkedin post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7079035811802832896?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7079035811802832896%29)

To add new implementation:

1. Copy template directory and rename it.
2. Modify /pom.xml with proper artifact name.
3. Update parent pom.xml to include new module.
