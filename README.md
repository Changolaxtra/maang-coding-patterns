# maang-coding-patterns
This repository has the purpose to have implementation examples of MAANG Coding Patterns, trying to make them easily extendable to different functionalities by providing functional interfaces.

- MAANG -> Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google
- MAANG -> Mandatory Algorithms for the Next Generation (I like this one :sunglasses:)
